  <h3>Problmes Causes Due to Deforartation</h3>
</div>
<div class="causes">
    <p>
        <h3>Loss of Habitat</h3>

One of the most dangerous and unsettling effects of deforestation is the loss of animal and plant species due to their loss of habitat. 70% of land animals and plant species live in forests. Not only does deforestation threaten species known to us, but also those unknown.

The trees of the rainforest that provide shelter for some species also provide the canopy that regulates the temperature. Deforestation results in a more drastic temperature variation from day to night, much like a desert, which could prove fatal for many inhabitants.
<h3>Increased Greenhouse Gases</h3>

In addition to the loss of habitat, the lack of trees also allows a greater amount of greenhouse gases to be released into the atmosphere. Healthy forests absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, acting as valuable carbon sinks. Deforested areas lose that ability and release more carbon.
<h3>Water in the Atmosphere</h3>

The trees also help control the level of water in the atmosphere by helping to regulate the water cycle. In deforested areas, there is less water in the air to be returned to the soil. This then causes dryer soil and the inability to grow crops.

		<h3>Soil Erosion and Flooding</h3>
Further effects of deforestation include soil erosion and coastal flooding. Trees help the land to retain water and topsoil, which provides the rich nutrients to sustain additional forest life.

Without forests, the soil erodes and washes away, causing farmers to move on and perpetuate the cycle. The barren land which is left behind in the wake of these unsustainable agricultural practices is then more susceptible to flooding, specifically in coastal regions.

<div class="videos"><h3>Measures:</h3></div>
<div class="causes">
	<h3>1. Regulation on the cutting of trees</h3>
	<p>The main reason for the increased deforestation is the industrial demand of trees. Although trees are perennial resource, large-scale exploitation can lead to the impossible revival. Regulated cutting and use of the rotational system can result in good timber crop harvesting without depleting the forest.</p><br>
	
	<h3>2. Controlling forest fires</h3>
	<p>Forest fires may start by natural means, although in most cases it’s by man either intentionally or non-intentionally. To save our forest, more advanced techniques of fire detection, an extinguishing must be adopted.</p><br>
	
	<h3>3. Increasing the percentage of land area under afforestation</h3>
	<p>Neglected areas that were previously used in farming should be used for tree growth. It will result in a qualitative use of abandoned soils thus a diversified afforestation.</p><br>
	
	<h3>4. Training the public on the importance of tree planting</h3>
	<p>Many people tend to assume afforestation due to their ignorance. Increased public awareness will lead to the development of green cities as well as develop an alternative to deforestation. Afforestation should be matured in kids so that the culture is passed on to the next generation.</p><br>
	
	<h3>5. Government involvement in afforestation</h3>
	<p>Although most governments of every country are particular on forest conservation, they are not implemented effectively. They should develop rules regulation with a strict follow-up like surveys on agroforestry resources, control the commercial use of forest and allocation of proper land for afforestation</p>
